# Oh My Zsh Plugin Installation Script

This is a quick install script for Oh My Zsh that also includes the zsh-auto-suggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting plugins.

Oh My Zsh is a community driven framework for managing zsh configurations. Many efficient plugins, themes, etc. can be installed. However, two popular plugins, `zsh-auto-suggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, are not directly included in Oh My Zsh, so their installation scripts have been modified to allow one-click installation.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
bash install_ohmyzsh_custom.sh
```
